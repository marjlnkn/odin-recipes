        <h3>A Basic Sandhwhich to curve your hunger in a pinch.</h3>
        <p>This is a basic sandwhich, and the ingredients can be interchanged, and can be made with whatever is available. This is just my preference if I have the ingredients.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Salami(I prefer Hot Genoa)</li>
            <li>Turkey Breast</li>
            <li>Any other meats you would like, however overdoing it may make the sandwhich too thick to eat comfortably.</li>
            <li>Bread, or any form of bun.</li>
            <li>Cheese, I prefer marble cheddar but if you have another preference that works too.</li>
            <li>Some people prefer lettuce, tomatoe, and sauce. Add these if desired, I for one am not a fan.</li>

        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the bun so the inside on both ends is facing upward. Cut if needed.</li>
            <li>Lay the ingredients down so that they follow a 1-after-the-other system. A good example is cheese Salami Turkey Cheese Salami Turkey.</li>
            <li>Place the second bun on top, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
